# Project Description
This project is designed to scrape entry-level cybersecurity job listings from an external job search API and save the data into a CSV file. The script sends a request to the API, retrieves job data specific to entry-level cybersecurity positions in Seattle, and processes the data into a structured format using pandas. This tool is useful for data analysts, job seekers, and researchers looking for insights into the entry-level job market in the cybersecurity field.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
1. How do I get a RapidAPI key?

   To acquire an API key is as simple as going to a website, for example www.rapidapi.com, select an API of choice. Set the necessary settings needed and test the API to make sure it's functional, once it's functional then proceed to coping the code and place it into your IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) and run it.

2. What happens if I exceed my API quota?

   Exceeding your API quota will return a "Failed to retrieve data: 429" error. A few solutions for this error are implement request throttling which is to limit the number of you send to the server over a given period. For example, pause for a few seconds between each request. Use API Key Rotation if allowed, if the API permits, rotate between multiple API keys to distribute the load. Contact Support, if you're consistently hitting rate limits, consider reaching out to the API provider for support or to request higher limits.

3. How do I report bugs or suggest features?
